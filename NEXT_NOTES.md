**Modular architecture**

 - All components being split up for Budgie 11
 - Raven = standalone, Panel = standalone, etc.

**Raven**

 - Return to Applets & Notifications only
 - Move Settings out completely
 - Resizable
 - Switch to drawer mode - i.e. overlap panels
 - Moving to out-of-process
 - Should support applets like:
    - RSS
    - Weather

**Theming**

 - Arc Styling will move back into the arc-gtk-theme repo
 - 11 Styling to be different ?

**Applet shift**

 - Sound Applet to merge into Panel Applet, and removed from Raven

**Settings**:

 - Removed from Raven, need a new method in which to control these
 - "budgie-settings"
 - Replace GCC completely, even with the system control components
 - Use Windowed Mode for 11
