[16:42] <ikey> the latter
[16:43] <ikey> start moving away from the darkness & 50 shades of purple
[16:43] <blaz_> Gotcha
[16:46] <blaz_> Okay. Yeah. The examples you provided are a good representation of what you've listed
[16:46] <ikey> obv im happy with whatever we end up with but thats whats playing on my mind lately
[16:47] <ikey> what would be very nice is a base budgie theme, and an extended solus variant..
[16:47] <ikey> we'll see
[17:00] <blaz_> I'm seeing a pattern going from SolusOS onward. Dark gray or black title and menu bars and panels, light window backgrounds for the content. The fresh colors are a massive departure.
[17:03] <blaz_> Oh. And the blues! :D
[17:04] <ikey> yeah always been the same
[17:04] <ikey> dark headers and lots of blue
[17:06] <ikey> i think we need bright colours
[17:07] <ikey> even in dark places we could use toned brights..
[17:07] <ikey> colours are known to affect mood.. and if you spend long enough in front of your computer it'll do the same
[17:07] <ikey> dark colours are reclusive
[17:07] <ikey> guarded
[17:07] <ikey> safe
[17:08] <ikey> bright colours are bold, invigorating, adventerous, playful
[17:08] <ikey> *adventurous
[17:08] <ikey> we should control that impact..
